- Having the parameters as simply variables in the class context
  doesn't do well optional parameters. References to self.SOMETHING
  crash if SOMETHING is not defined.

  of the secret as part of the merchant parameters instead of keeping
  it as a fixed value as is done now. Check this from the vendor docs.

- Need to have configurable decimal separator!
