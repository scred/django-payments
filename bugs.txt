BUGS
----

- Having the parameters as simply variables in the class context
  doesn't do well optional parameters. References to self.SOMETHING
  crash if SOMETHING is not defined.

- Are the merchant secrets versioned? Do we need to store the version
  of the secret as part of the merchant parameters instead of keeping
  it as a fixed value as is done now. Check this from the vendor docs.

- Need to have configurable decimal separator!

- Once this stuff is a bit more mature, the repository needs quite a
  bit of cleaning up.

- Check out Satchmo and see if we could make these payment processing
  modules a bit more compliant with how stuff is done there.

- The get_forms() methods do not return real Django forms, but only a
  dict. Should refactor so that in templates only form.render is
  necessary.

- No support for the payment button images has been implemented.
