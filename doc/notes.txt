how to make things work for a marketplace with multiple merchants?

Payable

 get_by_code() 

 get_cart()
 get_payment_methods()

 signal handlers

Payment
 
 init with identifier
 serialize -> kvps
 deserialize <- kvps
 simply have a kvp store for basic details
 audit kvp store
 cart: Cart

 parameters:
  - receiver: sometimes fixed sometimes not

PaymentDatastore

PaymentProcessor base class

  type label
  fixed params per type
  cart ??
  merchant params -> save in settings
  payment: Payment
  conversion matrix (for get_form)

  get_form()
   - fixed params (class variables)
   - merchant params from settins
   
  views

  success_view(request, method, code)
   - lookup processor by method
   - lookup payment by code
   - call processor.sucess_validate(request, payment)

  success_validate(request, payment)
   - do the checking
   - clear the payment
   - redirect to somewhere (known by payment)

PaymentProcessor()
 Paypal(PaymentProcessor)
 OnlineFiDebit(PaymentProcessor)
  Nordea(OnlineFiDebit)


Cart

1. first you create a cart
2. link the cart to a payment (ie, create the payment)
3. then checkout the payment

redirection after processing completes
validation?


using signals?

hooks to save, ie to storage

audit data storage with simple kvp
