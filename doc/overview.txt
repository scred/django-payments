Short intro on how "stuff" works


- Create a payment, ie something that is to be paid for.

- Set the core parameters of the payment.

- Add some items to the payment.

- Present a checkout page for the user. You can get the Django forms
  for the various payment buttons using payment.get_checkout_forms().

- After the user goes through her bank, she's returned to a generic
  payment view. Checking for return data validity is done.

- Finally redirection to a service's specific success (error or
  whatever) page is done.


Q: how to do the query? that's an additional method for the processor,
but is it accessed through the pament or the processor?
